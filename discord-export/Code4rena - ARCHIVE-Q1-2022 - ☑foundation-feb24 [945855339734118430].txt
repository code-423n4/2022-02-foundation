ℹ️  Hey wardens,  please note that for this contest, the gas optimization pool also includes contract-size optimizations.  You can submit findings for both under a *single* Gas report. Details will be in the contest README.

Reading the README.md and came across this line:

- FoundationTreasury.sol and its dependencies not used elsewhere:
  - AdminRole.sol
  - CollateralManagement.sol
  - OperatorRole.sol
  - WithdrawFromEscrow.sol

Does this mean that FoundationTreasury.sol and it's dependencies are out of scope. If any of FoundationTreasury dependencies are used elsewhere, then the dependencies are in-scope?

Thanks for the question! FoundationTreasury and any of it’s  dependencies, independent of where its used, are out of scope.

We already have 10 PRs queued up based on your submissions -- keep it coming!
(the changes will remain private until the contest is over to keep the competition fair)

I love the detailed feedback and suggestions being made. Thank you for diving deep!

Challenge our assumptions. Break stuff. Prevent users from losing NFTs or ETH. And help others learn best practices when the report goes public. 💪

We've been getting some DMs -- feel free to reach out! It could save you time ramping up.

I'm not going to say something is not an issue cause you are here to challenge our thinking. But we can explain our intent so you better understand the current logic and are then able poke holes in it 😉

Ah good catch. That's an issue with how the readme was cloned to the C4 site cc @itsmetechjay | C4 . If you go to the repo's readme and click the links from there they work. https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-foundation/blob/main/docs/FETH.md and https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-foundation/blob/main/docs/FNDNFTMarket.md

Thank you !

A great discovery was made this morning!

I can't wait to see what else you all come up with.

Hit me up with questions here or by DM. These chats seem to be helpful for both sides. On my end: we are considering simplifications, clarifying comments, and where our test suite could be improved to raise confidence. On their end: quick clarifications help them understand the flow so they can zoom in on where there may be real issues.

I feel like the conversations over DM are giving some wardens an unfair advantage. But it's not unfair - you can reach out too!

We want to help you find issues before our launch. We'll work with you to explore concerns, clarify intentions, and answer any questions about how things work. Just 2 days left now

24 hours to go!

C4 told us most of the submissions will arrive near the end. There have been a few great reports and some creative thinking already. We are eagerly watching the inbox to see what else you've found.

Final hour 🕚 
Remember to get those reports submitted!

If you have any notes or suggestions that for whatever reason didn't make it into one of your submissions, please DM them to me. We are looking over everything in detail, there could be a helpful nugget in there too.

Someone had sent us the test they used when researching an issue, if you have anything like that to share we'll drop it in our repo to help confirm the fix and prevent regressions.

89 reports submitted! You are amazing.

Thank you all so much for participating. I learned a lot and our code is getting better every day. Confidence in our upcoming launch is up 1000%.

We will complete the initial review of the submissions this week, then C4 judges take a pass before creating a public report of the findings. Stay tuned.
